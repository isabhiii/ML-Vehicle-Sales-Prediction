# ML Vehicle Sale Price Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes vehicle sales data from 2022 and leverages machine learning techniques to predict vehicle sale prices. Using Python and popular data science libraries, the workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and building a regression model to estimate prices based on various features such as mileage, manufacturer, fuel type, and more.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling using Linear Regression and Pipelines
- Evaluation of model performance
- Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step demonstration

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib notebook
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/isabhiii/ML-Vehicle-Sales-Prediction.git
    cd ML-Vehicle-Sales-Prediction
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook vehicle_sale_price_prediction.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the notebook for data analysis, model training, and prediction steps.

## Customization

- To use your own dataset, replace `vehicle_data.csv` with your data and adjust the notebook as needed.
- You can experiment with different regression models or feature engineering techniques by modifying the notebook.
